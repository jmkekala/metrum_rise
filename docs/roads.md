# Roads

## Purpose

This document is the live road-surface contract for Metrum Rise. It owns the shipped roadbed
runtime, editor preview / commit geometry parity, road-touched terrain integration, and the
guardrails that keep roads deterministic and performant.

Historical `ROAD-01` / `ROAD-02` hardcut notes are preserved in
[`archive/roads_hardcut_history_2026-05-31.md`](archive/roads_hardcut_history_2026-05-31.md).
That archive is reference-only; this file is authoritative.

This document does not own lane-routing policy, building frontage semantics, terrain storage
internals, or the shared engineered-ground model. Those are owned by
[`entrance_and_exit.md`](entrance_and_exit.md), [`terrain.md`](terrain.md), and
[`earthworks.md`](earthworks.md).

## Current Status

The roadbed rewrite is shipped for the current surface-road scope:

- the logical road graph owns connectivity, IDs, lanes, authored plan curves, and road class
- `RoadSurfaceSystem` owns the visible roadbed, query surface, terrain clip inputs, and chunk
  coverage
- road pieces are explicit `Span`, `Terminal`, `Bend`, and `JunctionN` visual carriers
- asphalt, curb / shoulder, sidewalk, markings, terrain clip loops, earthwork roots, and query
  support all derive from the same compiled piece ownership
- node pieces route through canonical rails, boolean ownership, height carriers, Spade
  triangulation, and validation
- grounded `Standard` road-touched terrain patches are generated in Rust with Spade CDT over
  unioned road-owned footprint loops
- ordinary grounded-road tie-ins use Rust-generated grade-limited guide samples around the final
  road-owned footprint; they do not emit retaining-wall mesh as a visual cleanup path
- Godot is a thin input/render bridge: it uploads cached payloads and must not decide road
  topology, heights, terrain holes, or material ownership

The old centerline-lift, generic node-patch, seam-strip, and renderer-owned road-hole paths are
retired.

## Ownership Boundaries

### Logical Graph

The graph is authoritative for:

- node and edge identity
- route connectivity
- lane counts and modal permissions
- authored road class: `Standard`, `Bridge`, or `Tunnel`
- authored plan polyline control points in world XZ

The graph is not the final visible road surface, final terrain clip carrier, final earthwork
boundary, or final node polygon carrier.

### RoadSurfaceSystem

`RoadSurfaceSystem` owns:

- edge longitudinal grade solutions
- ordered edge sections and lateral band profiles
- visual piece classification
- compiled road top-surface meshes
- visible-world road queries and picking support
- terrain clip loops for grounded roads
- road surface and terrain chunk coverage
- road debug geometry and provenance output

### TerrainSystem

`TerrainSystem` owns source terrain, visual terrain storage, chunk residency, and upload
boundaries. It consumes road-derived terrain clip / earthwork inputs; it must not decide road
heights or invent road seams.

### Godot

Godot-side road, terrain, and water scripts upload cached Rust payloads, bind materials, collect
input, and display debug data. They must not:

- resample terrain to repair road heights
- rebuild road topology from graph guesses
- clip road holes with `Geometry2D`
- mask missing topology with shader, water, zoning, material order, or background color
- perform expensive geometry decisions in editor input loops

## Roadbed Model

One authoritative roadbed model drives preview, committed mesh, visible-world picking, lane
marking anchors, terrain clip loops, and earthwork roots.

For every road-owned top surface:

- lateral width is explicit, not inferred from a centerline render offset
- each section stores center position, tangent, lateral axis, solved height, and ordered lateral
  bands
- band heights derive from the solved grade and explicit profile offsets
- preview and committed placement use the same Rust surface solve rules
- render triangles and query triangles use the same compiled ownership

The current required band model supports carriageway, curb / shoulder, sidewalk, and no-sidewalk
profiles. Later medians, parking lanes, cycle tracks, tram reservations, or richer shoulders must
add explicit ordered bands instead of special-case render offsets.

## Visual Pieces

### Span

`Span` owns ordinary edge corridors between node throats:

- span sections are ordered along the edge plan polyline
- every original edge knot and every node throat appears as a section
- long spans are refined by deterministic world-space constants owned in Rust code
- span output emits role-tagged asphalt, curb / shoulder, non-road, query, terrain clip, earthwork,
  and chunk coverage data

### Terminal

`Terminal` owns one-mouth endpoints:

- terminal asphalt follows the carriageway to the graph endpoint
- side non-road bands and end-band closure are explicit solved-band topology
- terminal caps are not generic annulus, disk, or endpoint helper geometry
- terminal output carries the same owner, height-field, provenance, and chunk-coverage contracts as
  other node pieces

### Bend And JunctionN

`Bend` and `JunctionN` share the node-region ownership model:

- `Bend` is a two-mouth node piece
- `JunctionN` is an `n >= 3` node piece
- mouths are sorted deterministically
- full-roadbed corridor candidates define the node footprint
- carriageway corridor candidates define asphalt
- `node_non_road = node_footprint - node_asphalt` is an intermediate domain only
- curb / shoulder and sidewalk are accepted only after explicit profile seam-rail evidence
- sidewalks may shrink, split, or disappear when asphalt legally owns the conflict region
- no non-road triangle may overlap asphalt or reconnect sidewalk islands across asphalt

The final node output is a canonical arrangement:

- every vertex has a canonical key, material owner, height-field owner, and grade authority
- every seam edge has explicit source / owner-pair provenance
- height is evaluated only after ownership and seam vertices are known
- missing, ambiguous, or conflicting owner / height support is a hard diagnostic, not a repair path
- Spade CDT triangulates already-owned material regions; CDT does not decide ownership

## Terrain And Earthworks

Grounded `Standard` roads replace visible terrain inside the road-owned footprint. Terrain under
asphalt, curb / shoulder, or sidewalk is not an independent visible carrier.

Road-touched terrain patches obey this contract:

- Rust unions grounded road-owned footprint loops for the patch before CDT input
- terrain patch rectangles, footprint loops, and source-terrain samples are inserted in canonical
  order
- road footprint constraints are clipped and split at patch boundaries before Spade input
- source-terrain samples are inserted only outside road-owned footprints
- Rust inserts deterministic grade-limited tie-in guide samples outside grounded `Standard`
  footprints before ordinary source terrain samples, so CDT has explicit near-road terrain
  vertices instead of fanning large triangles from the road seam to the terrain grid
- accepted terrain faces stay outside the unioned road-owned footprint
- rejected road-footprint faces are not emitted
- emitted terrain seam vertices reuse road-owned outer-edge coordinates and heights
- ordinary `Standard` span and node seam sources stay in the terrain bucket even when the authored
  terrain is steep; retaining-wall output is reserved for explicit structural bridge / tunnel /
  future retaining sources
- no shader mask, water plane, closure carpet, guard strip, or seam strip may replace missing
  topology

`Bridge` and `Tunnel` edges do not flatten or clip ordinary midspan terrain. Their terrain support
is limited to class-owned abutment or portal regions.

Structural earthwork stamping remains for explicit bridge, tunnel, retaining, and future
engineered-ground cases. Its current acceleration is chunk-local: prepared triangles are bucketed
inside dirty chunks, support candidates preserve the closest-distance / lower-height tie-break
rule, and writes are applied in canonical chunk order.

Shared engineered-ground rules live in [`earthworks.md`](earthworks.md).

## Preview, Query, And Editing

Editor preview must use the same road-surface solve rules as committed placement. Preview and
commit may differ in cache lifetime or display detail, but not in geometry ownership.

Visible-world queries use this precedence:

1. road-owned top surface
2. intentionally surfaced road earthwork / structure
3. visual terrain
4. source terrain only for terrain-only APIs

Road placement must not run heavy geometry synchronously from Godot mouse motion. Godot should
enqueue or poll Rust-owned preview results and keep input/render code thin.

Straight road edits should commit endpoint-only plan input. Curved edits may use deterministic
world-space sampling, but must preserve authored endpoints exactly. Oversampled straight Godot
`Curve3D` streams are not allowed to become semantic road input.

## Performance Contract

Correctness without acceptable performance is not done.

Required bounds:

- one local road edit rebuilds only touched spans, incident node pieces, and affected surface /
  terrain chunks
- dirty rebuilds use compiled piece coverage and `old_coverage union new_coverage`
- steady-state chunk rebuilds use sorted contributor lists; they must not scan every compiled node
  piece in the world
- independent span and chunk work should use Rayon when mutation boundaries allow it
- hot-path loops must avoid avoidable allocation
- road debug output must split terrain, water, zoning, and total patch-debug timings
- road debug output must use cached zoning statistics instead of scanning parcel payloads

The current remaining large editor hitch is synchronous final `JunctionN` compilation on very large
multi-mouth nodes. Future responsiveness work should be tracked as new road-performance work:

- async final compile with versioned jobs
- immutable compile snapshots
- deterministic latest-result publication
- old-mesh / pending-mesh visual state
- incremental `JunctionN` compile or stronger contact/export indexing

Do not reopen shipped `ROAD-01` geometry hardcuts for editor responsiveness unless the fix changes
the roadbed ownership contract itself.

## Debug And Diagnostics

`--debug road` must report enough data to locate ownership failures before rendering hides them:

- dirty edge / node / chunk counts
- node kind and incident mouth count
- rail, ownership, arrangement, triangulation, export, and validation timings
- contact candidate counts and emitted constraint counts
- terrain CDT input/output counters
- retained road seam constraint counters
- provider-specific terrain / water / zoning debug timings
- structured node diagnostics with stage, backend, owner, source band, height field, canonical key,
  point / edge, residual, seam, and constraint metadata

Missing source rails, missing carrier provenance, rejected residuals, open boundaries, duplicate
exposed edges, non-explicit boundary vertices, ambiguous carrier support, and height conflicts are
diagnostics. They must not become silent visual fallbacks.

## Forbidden Regressions

Do not reintroduce:

- centerline-only road lifting or terrain flattening
- terrain fallback sampling for road height
- nearest-height, nearest-owner, min/max, averaging, owner-priority, or old-road-wins repair
- render z-bias as geometry
- shader, water, zoning, material-order, cull-mode, or background masking for missing topology
- seam strips, closure carpets, guard strips, miter caps, or connector patches not derived from
  final canonical ownership
- paired adjacent-mouth strips as final node ownership
- generic node disks, annuli, halos, or global sidewalk rings
- Godot-side road topology, terrain clipping, or road-height decisions
- fallback from Spade CDT failure into old terrain clipping
- full-network road or terrain rebuilds for one local edit
- treating tiny boundary-touching missing material shapes as acceptable unless they are proven
  canonical numeric dust under the documented budget

`FinalTopBoundaryPair` is diagnostic only. It must not become an emitted road-surface vertical-face
source again.

## Test Contract

Maintained coverage must continue to prove:

- flat and cross-slope grounded spans
- bridge spans and tunnel portals
- terminal cap ownership
- bend ownership across acute, right, obtuse, shallow, and arbitrary angles
- T, 4-way, and `N > 4` `JunctionN` ownership
- mixed-width, mixed-profile, no-sidewalk, and one-sided footpath cases
- preview / commit parity
- visible-world query precedence
- terrain CDT preservation of road seam constraints
- rejection of terrain faces inside road-owned footprints
- authored and imported DEM terrain agreement
- deterministic rebuilds and equivalent edit-order identity
- local invalidation without unrelated chunk rebuilds
- rendered mesh upload containing the same canonical raised-step intervals as the compiled surface

Use the focused surface tests for narrow changes and the full `surface` suite when changing shared
ownership, terrain, query, node, or render contracts.

## Archive

The archived hardcut history remains useful when investigating why a repair path is forbidden or
why a particular provenance rule exists:

Do not update the archive as live planning. Update this file, [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md), and
[`project.md`](project.md) for current road status.
